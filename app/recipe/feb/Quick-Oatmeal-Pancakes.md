My husband used to not like pancakes and absolutely hate pancake syrup until I had him try the oatmeal pancake with mango or blueberry sauce. Now he regularly asks me to make some for breakfast. Serve warm with your favorite syrup or sauce.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk 
- 2/3 cup quick-cooking oats
- 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

# Instructions

1. Place 1 cup milk in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until bubbling, about 2 minutes. Stir in the oats.
2. Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk eggs, 2 teaspoons melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; add 1/4 cup milk. Mix oat mixture and egg mixture with flour mixture; stir to combine.
3. Heat 2 teaspoons butter on a griddle or skillet over medium heat; pour about 1/3 cup batter into the hot butter. Cook pancakes until bubbles appear on top layer, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook other side until evenly browned, about 5 more minutes.
